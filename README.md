# pisend source
 The unwieldy source for pisend

pisend is an evolution of constantly trying to nail down the uart/pi0. Its not perfect at all but I'm hoping making this open source will help other people how talking to the pi0 can be achieved. 

pisend-v15.asm 
- the latest 2.20

Please dont submit corrections for things that look like redundant code, only actual areas of improvement. 

Also included in checkpi.asm which is an attempt to clean up, and checkpi-tostring.asm is an attempt to get a string back.

The checkpi ones are just examples and hopefully will help you work out how to talk with NextPi to some degree.
